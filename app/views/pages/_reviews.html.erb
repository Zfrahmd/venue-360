        I'm really happy with my stay at this place
        It's easy to find and the security is maximum.
        The proximity to a restaurant in the same building makes life easier as soon as you're hungry
        The lady who manages everything is really very responsive to all requests and with  joy
        I highly recommend it.</p>

        <p class="mb-0"><strong>It was a wonderful stay! I'll definitely be back! and if you're like me - 
        reluntant to book a stay because there aren't</strong></p>
        <p>
        From the moment I stepped in, the apartment felt so welcoming! I was skeptical while booking because it didn't have any reviews and seemed new, but it was truly N incredible stay. The staff were great, the apartment was clean and very comfortable. 
        There's a restaurant downstairs where you get 15% off on meals, there's a microwave and a fridge in the room as well. Truly one of the properties where what you see is what you get. 
        <br><br>
        It is located in Aberdeen which is close to the city center or at least you can get anywhere with a tuk-tuk (keke â€” which is popular in Freatown). 
        <br><br>
        The WiFi connection isn't very stable but that could be said for the entire city. Also, there's a standby generator but the power goes off every now and then, and when it does, the water with it. The generator comes on in a minute or two so if you're in the shower just about this time, hold on just a bit!
